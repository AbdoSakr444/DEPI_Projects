# Examination System Database Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a complete **Database Design and Implementation** for an **Examination System**.  
It covers **Entity-Relationship design, database schema creation, sample data insertion, and SQL queries** to manage and retrieve data efficiently.

The system is intended to manage:
- Student and exam information
- Question banks
- Exam scheduling
- Results storage and retrieval

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- **Database**: Oracle / MySQL / PostgreSQL (depending on project requirements)
- **SQL Client**: Any SQL execution tool such as:
  - Oracle SQL Developer
  - MySQL Workbench
  - pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL)

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Create the Database**
   - Run the `ES_DDL.sql` file to create all tables and constraints.

2. **Insert Sample Data**
   - Execute the `ES_DML.sql` file to populate the database with sample data.

3. **Run Queries**
   - Use `ES_Queries.sql` to test and interact with the database.
